This program opens and reads NCDF files.  It requires two supporting function files, rh15d.py and ImageLoadSourceFunctions.py to function properly.  

All image files saved go under the current working directory.

Keys:
x = lock image
s = save image
esc = reset image
z = selectable zoom area
scroll wheel to zoom
right drag to move image
